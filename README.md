# obsi
 
a online **[WYSIWYG Markdown editor](https://milkdown.dev/)** that uses google drive's api to get & save documents

i made this because google doc sucks on chromebook and this made it just a bit better üëç

inspired off of [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)

there is still missing some stuff and a lot of the buttons don't work (maybe ill add it later?? idk..), but the main functionality is there. you can login with your google account, open up google docs and edit them and they will automatically save and yeah.

this is how the google doc file looks like. since its using markup you can see the #'s, *'s, etc
